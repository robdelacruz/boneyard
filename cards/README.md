Cards (CSS modules)
-------------------

See cards.html to view markup of all cards components. Each 'card' is identified by a container tag with its card id in the class attribute.

Ex.
(html)

    <header class="masthead-card">
    <nav class="horizontal-menu-card">

(css)

    .masthead-card {
    }


cards.html and other sample html files will be updated as new cards are added.
style.css is the stylesheet for all card components.

This was developed originally for Web Curator but can be used for any web project.
