Notes Buddy

A general purpose note taking application.

Features:
  - Add/edit/delete 'nodes'
  - Annotate with text or numeric fields.
  - Find and query nodes.
  - Sum up numeric fields.

Examples:
  Add some new nodes
  $ nb add -.title "Bus fare to work" -.amt 2.75 -.cat "commute"
  $ nb add -.title "McDonald's expense" -.amt 4.99 -.cat "dine_out"
  $ nb add -.title "coffee" -.amt 1.75 -.cat "dine_out"
  $ nb add -.title "lunch" -.amt 7.00 -.cat "food"
  $ nb add -.title "Bus fare going home" -.amt 2.75 -.cat "commute"

  Add a longer note interactively
  $ nb add -pipe
  .title Gettysburg Address
  .author Abraham Lincoln
  Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
  continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to
  the proposition that all men are created equal.
  <CTRL-D>

  Query for nodes
  $ nb find -select title,cat,amt -where "cat = 'commute'"
  $ nb find -select title,amt -where "cat = 'dine_out' and amt > 5.0"

  Query with sum (subtotals)
  $ nb find -select title,amt -where "cat = 'dine_out'" -total amt

  Full text search on nodes
  $ nb find "sherlock holmes"

  Specify a specific table for a node
  $ nb add -tbl work -.title "Work Node" "This goes in work table"

  Query on specific table
  $ nb find -tbl work -select title,body

  Eval mode
  $ nb run "find -select title,amt -total amt"

  List tables
  $ nb info tables

  List table fields
  $ nb info fields nbdata


You can associate as many fields as you want in a node. Fields may
hold any kind of value, textual or numeric. Sqlite is used as the
backing store of the nodes. As you add new unique fields to a node,
the sqlite table is automatically altered to accomodate the new
fields.

Each node has a 'pubdate' and 'moddate' field in ISO 8601 datetime format 
that can be used in queries. A way to more intelligently query date ranges
is being planned in the future.

Typeless fields are provided through the excellent sqlite library, which
uses typeless table fields by design. It's the sqlite library which
really makes this program possible. Sometimes I think that this app is
really just an interface wrapper around sqlite!

Future features to be developed:
  GUI
  Webservice and webapp
  Date range queries

Build:
  $ ./b
  will build the 'nb' executable.

Environments:
  Linux only for now. Not tested on Mac OS.
